## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 4


### What I learned
This is my first frontend Challenge that i accepted reached as closer as i am able to , If you think i can change the style and get much more closer then please let me know.
While working in this challenge, I learn a lot about positioning the card and change a full fledge hover state over an image, that was the task I like most as it was little bit more challenging.


### Continued development

I am too beginner in this field hence whatever it will be possible i will get to know about them .
